This makes our company one of the best <strong>Iranian apple suppliers<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Iran produces different kinds of apples such as Red Delicious, Golden Delicious, and yellow apples. There are 251,000 hectares of orchards in Iran. Each hectare provides 15 tons of apples per year.

On top of that, the apple\u2019s aroma is another element that should be considered when buying a good apple, which most Iranian apples have.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on the rootstock type (standard, semi-dwarf, dwarf), they can reach heights from 0.6 to 3 meters.&nbsp;Iranian <a href=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/fruits\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">fruit export company<\/a> and apple suppliers, export apples to many countries, including&nbsp;India, Georgia, and Iraq. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For transporting apples, we need to consider some points. It is required to keep the apples in a cool and dark place to transport them in the best way possible. To reach that goal, we need an advanced tracker to measure the temperature and humidity. Any slight change in the temperature and humidity can ruin the apple and lead us to our customers\u2019 dissatisfaction. To answer that need, we have our unique tracer device. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our skillful team has been working in this field for so long that now they know every detail about the apple business.

Iran ranks first in producing pomegranates, pistachios, dates, and cherries, and second, fourth, and seventh in producing apples, walnuts, and citrus fruit. There are fifty different types of fruit grown in Iran.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How are apples preserved for export?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A sealed room reduces the amount of oxygen that the fruit can take in and put out in the form of carbon dioxide, thus slowing the ripening.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this process, oxygen is replaced by nitrogen gas. Temperatures are reduced and kept in the low.

Iran is one of the top producers of apples due to the planting of different species of apple trees with high quality throughout the country. In Iran, all kinds of apple trees have their own flavor and color, but among all of them, the red apple is very valuable due to its delicious taste and has attracted international attention. The red apple tree is cultivated primarily in six provinces in Iran. From the point of view of both quality and quantity, Iran&#8217;s northwest provinces are the best for producing red apples. The red apples are grown without chemical pesticides and preservatives, so they are healthier and taste better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Iran Red Apple Season<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Iranian apple prices are affected by the season when the apples are harvested. Harvesting of Iranian Red Apples begins in early October and will last until the end of June, just as it does in the northern hemisphere. The markets will be more competitive as a result. Due to transportation costs, these two have their customers, but the rest of the competition&#8217;s factors will be based on international standards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Iran Red Apple Storing<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In Iran, there are many exporting companies that specialize in apples and consider customer needs like fresh fruit. When apples cannot be delivered to markets within the time or circumstance, they are stored. It is recommended that the apple be stored at a temperature of 0.5\u00b0C in every chamber.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Iran Red Apple Export Markets<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In spite of some countries in the middle east producing apples, Iran is the region&#8217;s largest producer. Because of lower transportation costs and the fact that it arrives in these markets fresh, this is the best way to import Iranian Red Apple. Iranian apples are also widely exported, with the Iranian red apple being exported to 24 countries annually. Depending on the type, size, harvesting season, and transportation costs, Iranian apples could be priced differently on international markets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A popular brand of Iranian apples is Red Delicious. Among Russia&#8217;s best target markets is Red Delicious, a famous variety of Iranian red apples. They were cultivated in an organic way and served the local market needs, while the first-grade apples were exported to the global market in high demand and gained 3% of their sales. On top of that, their goods are always high quality and affordable, causing other industries to be interested in becoming their regular customers on a large scale.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many investors are interested in controlling its sales conditions. However, there is a considerable difference between the retail price and the wholesale price of Iranian apples, and many consumers pay attention to the product because of its satisfaction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"1110\" height=\"450\" src=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/apple-supplier.webp\" alt=\"Iranian apple supplier\" class=\"wp-image-1916\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>The apple and its history<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The apple tree, which belongs to the rose family is one of the most popular, frequently cultivated, and very old fruit in the world that has different types. There are many stories about apples, but this delicious and useful fruit has always been in demand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From a botanical point of view, the apple fruit is a special form of the so-called collective bellows fruit. Being an <strong>Apple supplier<\/strong> is what traders do from the past to the present. The apple originally comes from Asia, and the development of the first wild species can even be traced back to the Cretaceous &#8211; 70 million years ago. The apple is said to have been brought to Europe by Alexander the Great &#8211; during the campaigns from Persia.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many varieties of this fruit are now found all over the world, most of which have no role in world trade. Among its various varieties, <strong>Iranian apple<\/strong> is one of the most popular, the quality of which has put us in competition with other huge exporters. If you are looking for a high-quality <strong>apple exporter<\/strong> then you should try Vira Fruits Apples which are prepared with the most up-to-date facilities and care conditions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"1110\" height=\"450\" src=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/care-conditions-and-soil.webp\" alt=\"care conditions and soil\" class=\"wp-image-1939\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Care conditions and soil<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple trees thrive best in deep, nutrient-rich soils that are provided with humus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cold, wet locations lead to poor tree and fruit development and increased disease infestation. It is important to have a location that is not at risk of late frost, as the open apple-blossom can only tolerate minus one degree Celsius.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fruit trees have to be cut regularly in order to develop new fruit trees and to be freed of old wood. If the apple tree is cut too late in the year, it may no longer sprout properly and bear significantly less fruit. The first cut is therefore made in the spring on a mild day without rain, as the branches are no longer too brittle and not many buds have sprouted yet. When pruning in spring, it is important to ensure that temperatures are above -5 \u00b0 C at night in order to promote wound healing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While we handle these conditions with great care, a typical exporter can consider himself solely responsible for warehousing and shipping the product. But we at Vira Fruits, as a professional apple exporter, try to use the Iranian apple type, which has passed all the stages from planting to harvest in the best way.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Red Delicious, Gala, Fuji, Golden, Florin<br \/>\nWithout sugar content at any time of the year, Customized packaging as per clientele order<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":7,"featured_media":367,"parent":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","template":"","meta":[],"tags":[],"sproduct_cat":[8],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v15.5 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Iranian apple exporter, Vira Fruits supply and export various varieties of Iranian apple: Iranian red apple, Royal Gala, Pink Lady, Fuji, and Red Delicious apple.\" \/>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/fruits\/apple\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Iranian Apple exporter and apple supplier\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"Iranian apple exporter, Vira Fruits supply and export various varieties of Iranian apple: Iranian red apple, Royal Gala, Pink Lady, Fuji, and Red Delicious apple.\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:url\" content=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/fruits\/apple\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:site_name\" content=\"Vira Fruits Export\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:modified_time\" content=\"2022-06-13T05:09:01+00:00\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:card\" content=\"summary_large_image\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:image\" content=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/apple.webp\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:label1\" content=\"Est. reading time\">\n\t<meta name=\"twitter:data1\" content=\"8 minutes\">\n<!-- \/ Yoast SEO plugin. -->","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/sproduct\/279"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/sproduct"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/sproduct"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/7"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=279"}],"version-history":[{"count":82,"href":"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/sproduct\/279\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2662,"href":"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/sproduct\/279\/revisions\/2662"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/367"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=279"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=279"},{"taxonomy":"sproduct_cat","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/sproduct_cat?post=279"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
