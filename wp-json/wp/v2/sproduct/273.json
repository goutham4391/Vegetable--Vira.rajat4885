The fruits are bright green and crunchy in large clusters when young but mature to become soft, chewy, and delicious when mature, and vary in color from light brown to almost black. The drier and smaller varieties are usually smaller, whereas the darker types darken almost to black. For thousands of years, dates have provided nourishment for the Middle Eastern culture and are regarded as a &#8220;tree of life.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is best to describe the ripening process as a four-stage process:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>unripe<\/li><li>crunchy<\/li><li>semi-dry or soft<\/li><li>sun-dried<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Although they usually hang on the tree until they are fully ripened, they are often harvested earlier so the drying process can be controlled.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite being dried, dates fruit is not totally dehydrated like dried apricots. The reason that you should keep them in a cool place is that they still contain some moisture. A date earned its name from its oval shape, which is based on the Greek word daktylos, meaning finger.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For growing, the date palm needs a hot climate, which makes it indigenous to the Middle East and North Africa. The calories and nutrients contained in one cup of this fruit can sustain human life even in dry, barren locations. That is the reason why bedouins used to live off dates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How is the taste?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the wrinkles on the outside, this sweet, delicious, and sticky fruit is still soft and sweet on the inside. Their flavor is very much like chocolate, with notes of butterscotch, cinnamon, and toffee. It has been said that their flavor is similar to a cross between a prune and a fig, without the cinnamon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"1110\" height=\"450\" src=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/what-are-the-health-benefits.webp\" alt=\"health benefits of dates\" class=\"wp-image-1759\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>What are the dates health benefits?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Since dates contain high levels of natural sugars, most people consider them healthy. Its excellent nutritional value, fiber content, and antioxidant content make it an ideal sweet fruit for health. Dates are beneficial for combat fatigue, digestive health, weight management, inflammation, and heart and muscle health improvement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Classification<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If we want to classify dates by their type, here is how it goes:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Dried Dates: When the moisture content is less than 15%<\/li><li>Semi Dried Dates: when the moisture level is between 15% and 18%<\/li><li>Fresh Dates: This is when moisture is between 18% and 35%<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>What kinds of Dates do we have in Vira Fruits?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"1110\" height=\"450\" src=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/mazafati-dates.webp\" alt=\"dates exporter mazafati dates\" class=\"wp-image-1757\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mazafati dates<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Known as date Bam, Mazafati dates are among the most renowned and popular varieties of Iran dates fruit.
