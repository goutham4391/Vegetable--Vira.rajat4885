Since they are generally sweet, people often think that a diabetic person should avoid consuming fruits. However, some are especially effective in managing blood sugar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diabetes<\/strong> is a serious chronic disease that occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin, the hormone that regulates the level of sugar or glucose in the blood, or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to estimates by the World Health Organization (WHO), 422 million adults worldwide had diabetes in 2014, up from 108 million in 1980. The global prevalence of diabetes has nearly doubled since that year, from 4.7% to 8.5% in the adult population.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Diabetes is classified into two types:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One: when the body does not produce insulin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two: when the body is not able to properly use the insulin it produces.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An eating plan for people with diabetes should include: foods rich in nutrients, low in fat, few sugary foods and moderate in calories. Each patient should always check with their doctor if the suggestions apply to them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Diabetics need to consider the <strong>glycemic index<\/strong> (The Glycemic Index is a relative rating of carbohydrate in foods regarding how they affect blood glucose level) of foods to know how they affect blood sugar and insulin level. Taking these factors into account, some fruits for diabetics are better than others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fruit with a low glycemic index<\/strong> (55 and below) is believed to have a beneficial effect on blood glucose control, as they do not significantly affect sugar level. Those with a glycemic index score of 70 and above are considered high glycemic index foods.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><mark style=\"background-color:#fcb900\" class=\"has-inline-color\">More information: <a href=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/fruits\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Fruit export company<\/a><\/mark><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The 10 best fruits for diabetics<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the following, we will introduce 10 fruits with low glycemic index.
