There is no problem with that, but if you are not willing to eat fruits, I fear that a healthy plate is incomplete without fruits and vegetables.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have kids, you might be familiar with these cases. &#8220;Apple?

A study from Johns Hopkins University, a private research university, on consuming fruit was conducted, the result was not very promising. It showed that only 11 percent of the adults ate the USDA-recommended serving fruits per day.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can answer the question of &#8220;what will happen to the body <strong>if you don&#8217;t eat fruits?<\/strong> or what are the<strong> results of not eating fruit&#8221;<\/strong> by casting a glance at the food pyramid. Fruit and vegetables have accounted for a large part of the pyramid.
