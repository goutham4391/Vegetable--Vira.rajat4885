The easiest way to <strong>choose an Iranian apple<\/strong> is to purchase them in a presorted bag at the grocery store. This article provides information about choosing apples for baking, checking for freshness at the grocery store, picking apples from a tree, and storing them properly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Checking Apple Quality<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"500\" src=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/check-apple-for-obvious-defects.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2443\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Check for obvious defects<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can tell that the apple has gone bad if it has rotten spots, dark brown spots, or if it has become too soft. The apple does not have to be blemished or shiny to be bad. The appearance of bruises and rotten spots is different from blemishes caused by growing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should gently wipe at spots to see if they are simply dirty or if there is an issue. When bruises are not very deep and small, they are fine to cut around because they can be cut around.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bruised apple or one that is mushy indicates that it is rotten deep within the apple. You should avoid such apples.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"500\" src=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/be-aware-of-cuts.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2444\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Be aware of cuts<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>During picking and transport, apples can sometimes get small nicks or slices in addition to bruises. The exposed flesh becomes brown when this occurs. The flesh of the apple will be exposed and will be bad if it has excessive cuts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Small cuts here and there are no cause for concern. It is just a matter of ensuring the whole apple isn&#8217;t cut.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"500\" src=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/check-the-color-apple.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2445\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Check the color when choosing an Iranian apple<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When Iranian apples are fully ripe, their color is usually red or orange. Golden Delicious and Granny Smith apple colors are light yellow and green, respectively, but otherwise, a green apple probably isn&#8217;t very ripe. The redder the apple, the better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, apples with strong colors tend to be tastier than those that are dull.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It isn&#8217;t necessary that apples always have a solid color. However, if half of the apple is green (when it should be red), it hasn&#8217;t ripened evenly and may not be the best option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"500\" src=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/examine-iranian-apple-firmness.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2446\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Examine its firmness when choosing an Iranian apple<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Hold it between your index finger and thumb. Gently squeeze it. Be careful not to bruise it with excessive pressure. This apple is good if you give it a light squeeze and it does not squish. To ensure the apple is firm, squeeze a few spots around it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"500\" src=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/sniff-iranian-apple.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2447\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Sniff the Iranian apple<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apples that are past their prime freshness will often smell stale. If an apple smells bad, it is probably bad. Apples that have gone bad will smell rotten, while apples that are still goodwill smell sweet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There&#8217;s no exact science behind smelling quality, but it&#8217;s a powerful indicator.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Choosing the Right Option<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"500\" src=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/select-right-option-for-apple.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2448\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Select the right option for the apple<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It may be a good idea to buy different kinds of apples if you are baking or eating fresh apples. Pie won&#8217;t turn out if you use apples that don&#8217;t bake well. Making an informed purchase decision about which apple to purchase is easier if you know ahead of time what purpose it will serve.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is best to use Fuji, Goldrush, and Red Delicious for salads since they don&#8217;t brown as quickly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For apple butter, Jonamac, Spigold, and Cortland are recommended because they retain their flavor during cooking and pair well with the spices used.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Applesauce can be made with Jonagold, Cortland, and Yellow Delicious apples. For pink applesauce, leave the skin on if the skin is red.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"500\" src=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/check-apple-guide.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2449\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Check an apple guide for details<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Knowing the types of apples will allow you to choose an Iranian apple and use them more effectively. Additionally, this is helpful when it comes to personal preference, as some people prefer extra sweet apples, while others prefer tart apples. There are crunchy and softer apples.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, Red Delicious are a classic snack but should not be baked or used in sauces. Golden Delicious, on the other hand, can be eaten fresh as well as baked.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apple varieties that are sweet include Ambrosia, Honeycrisp, and Fuji. It is said that Granny Smith and Jazz apples are a little tarter and tangier than other apples.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"500\" src=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/visit-apple-orchard-.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2450\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Visit an orchard during apple season<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>choosing an Iranian apple and getting apples from an orchard is more convenient and easier than buying apples from the store. Getting apples that are not weeks or months old might be worth the extra effort if you can get to an orchard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plan a visit to an orchard near you by looking online. Not only is this a great activity for the family, but it is also a necessity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"500\" src=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/choose-organic-local-iranian-apples.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2451\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Choose organic or local apples<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Pesticides are often used by apple growers to keep bugs away from the trees. In this way, non-organically grown apples are laden with pesticides when they&#8217;re sold in stores. Apples grown organically are pesticide-free, making them healthier for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Fresh Iranian apples<\/strong> can be found at farmer&#8217;s markets. Moreover, they may come from smaller orchards where they may have been tended more carefully.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Locally grown apples are also likely to be fresher since they don&#8217;t have to be transported long distances.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apple Picking<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"500\" src=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/easy-harvest.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2452\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Select apples that come easily off the tree<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you pull the best Iranian apples fresh from the tree, they tend to fall off easily. Just lift up the apple and gently twist it. It should come loose easily. It&#8217;s not ready if it&#8217;s hard to get it loose.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"500\" src=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/apples-are-outside-tree.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2453\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Select apples that are on the outside of the tree<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Fruit on outer branches ripens first, so pick from the farthest branches when picking from the tree. The outside of the tree might have already been picked, so you may want to move inward if it is later in the season. Apples on inner branches are not unripe, just that they ripen more slowly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"500\" src=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/put-iranian-apples-gently.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2454\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Put the apples gently in the basket<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You should not drop apples into containers when picking from the tree or buying in the store. You&#8217;ll bruise the apples if you pick and drop, however, so you won&#8217;t be able to eat them as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apple Storage<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"500\" src=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/store-apples-with-other-fruits.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2455\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Do not store apples with other fruits<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Over time, apples release ethylene gas. Due to this gas, other fruit will ripen more quickly, and will not last as long. When you can, store apples in an area of the refrigerator away from other fruit in an unsealed plastic bag.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should also leave the bag open to allow the apple gas to escape. Gas trapped in an apple bag will accelerate the deterioration process of the apples as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"500\" src=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/store-apples-strong-smelling.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2456\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Don&#8217;t store apples with strong smelling foods<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If kept close to other foods, apples can absorb the smells. Iranian apple should be kept in a separate drawer whenever possible. As far as possible, store them in the refrigerator away from strong-smelling foods.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Store other foods in tightly sealed containers to prevent the smell from spreading throughout the fridge. Apples will be able to smell onions if they are exposed to them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Garlic, fish, and most types of pepper should also be sealed and kept away from apples.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"500\" src=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/unrefrigerated.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2457\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>1 to 2 weeks unrefrigerated<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no problem leaving apples out on the counter. They will go bad much more quickly if they are left out of the refrigerator. The shelf life of apples is 6-8 weeks when stored cold, but only 1-2 weeks at room temperature.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The apples you buy may not be as ripe as you want them to be, so you can leave them out for a few days and then put them in the refrigerator. Although they won&#8217;t last as long as those kept cold, they will last longer than if left out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apples left out can also attract insects, although this isn&#8217;t a problem in the refrigerator.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Learn how to choose apples for baking, check for freshness at the grocery store, pick apples from a tree, and store them properly by reading this article.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":4,"featured_media":2442,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[506,499,503,498,500,497,512,507,501,496,510,508,502,511,504],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v15.5 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"choose an Iranian apple: Check the color, examine its firmness, Sniff, obvious defects, cut and ...\" \/>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/blog\/how-to-choose-an-iranian-apple\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"How to choose an Iranian apple?\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"choose an Iranian apple: Check the color, examine its firmness, Sniff, obvious defects, cut and ...\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:url\" content=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/blog\/how-to-choose-an-iranian-apple\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:site_name\" content=\"Vira Fruits Export\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:published_time\" content=\"2022-01-06T07:30:00+00:00\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:modified_time\" content=\"2022-01-03T08:41:19+00:00\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:card\" content=\"summary_large_image\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:image\" content=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/how-to-choose-an-iranian-apple.webp\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:label1\" content=\"Est. reading time\">\n\t<meta name=\"twitter:data1\" content=\"6 minutes\">\n<!-- \/ Yoast SEO plugin. -->","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2458"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/4"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2458"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2458\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2459,"href":"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2458\/revisions\/2459"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2442"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2458"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2458"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2458"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
