Maybe this method seems strange at first. But it is entirely scientific and proven. Around 80 percent of men and 50 percent of women suffer from hair loss worldwide. As we grow older, androgens might cause hair loss. But according to researchers in Baghdad, there&#8217;s something you can do to stop those nasty androgens from stealing your hair: onion juice. Then, those looking for a remedy for unexplained hair loss may have used onion juice to grow their hair as an effective remedy. In the following, We&#8217;ll tell you how onion juice promotes hair growth and beauty.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Thanks to onion juice for Hair growth<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is already known that onions not only help with colds and digestive problems but also keep the vascular system young. However, onion has other properties that make it a real beauty weapon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The scientists were able to prove that onion juice can accelerate hair growth. For their study, the researchers at the University Hospital in Baghdad treated the scalps of 38 subjects suffering from hair loss twice a day with onion juice. After just two weeks, the researchers noticed new hair sprouting from the bald spots. After four weeks, this was the case for 74 percent of the participants in the study. And after six weeks, 87 percent of the volunteers had their hair back.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-container-2 wp-block-gallery-1 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"500\" data-id=\"2895\"  src=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/onion-juice-6.jpg\" alt=\"hair loss- hair fall- hairs in brush\" class=\"wp-image-2895\"\/><\/figure>\n<\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Can onion juice help with severe hair loss?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If your hair is falling out in large quantities or if you have bald spots on your head, treatment with onion juice will not be successful. As rich as the ingredients in the onion are, they cannot sprout new follicles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Can any type of hair loss be repaired with onion juice?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Not at all; onion juice does not affect hair loss due to genetic or disease-related causes or hair loss due to emotional stress. Onion juice home remedies can have a positive effect if your hair loss is due to nutrients or inflammation. To achieve the desired effect, you must know the cause of hair loss.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A doctor who examines the scalp and reads your general state of health in the blood count will help you to find the cause.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>In general, you should know that the juice of an onion serves as a support. If you are under constant negative stress, the hair loss regulates itself with your focus on more peace in life.<\/li><li>You must consult your doctor if you lose hair due to illness or medication.<\/li><li>Diffuse hair loss without a diagnosed cause is, in many cases, diet-related.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether and to what extent you experience a visible effect is primarily based on the causes and reasons for the hair loss. Because onion juice is a natural product, you can try its use and not worry about any risks or side effects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if the hair growth-promoting effect is absent, you will not damage the scalp or the follicles by using onion juice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-container-4 wp-block-gallery-3 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"500\" data-id=\"2902\"  src=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/onion-juice-8.jpg\" alt=\"onion beside onion juice- onion juice- onion juice benefits\" class=\"wp-image-2902\"\/><\/figure>\n<\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Facts about onion juice for hair growth<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>How onions juice stimulates hair growth? Scientists have not (yet) been able to find an explanation for this. However, various theories exist about how onion juice could cause hair to sprout. The sulfur from the onion is said to help supply the hair roots with the nutrients they need to grow. Since sulfur is also found in keratin, an important component of hair, it could be responsible for hair growth. Onions also have antibacterial and antioxidant properties. This protects and cares for the scalp, which is also important for hair growth, as hair can only thrive on a healthy scalp. Then onion juice for hair growth and scalp.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, onions contain a wide variety of nutrients, including vitamin C, various B-family vitamins, calcium, potassium, iron, phosphorus, manganese, and magnesium, as well as antioxidants, phenolic compounds, and anthocyanins. Onions have Flavonoids such as kaempferol and quercetin with an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effect. Then shampoo and oils can also be made from onion to improve dry and damaged hair and reduce itching and dandruff. Onions contain the enzyme catalase, known for its anti-aging effects, which means that onion juice can also minimize age-related hair loss. Treatments with onion juice can improve blood circulation in your scalp so that the hair follicles are again supplied with sufficient nutrients and oxygen. Now, we know, There are good reasons why the ancient Egyptians and healers in Asia swore by onions as a hair restorer. The onion is, therefore, a real miracle weapon for the hair and scalp.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-container-6 wp-block-gallery-5 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"500\" data-id=\"2897\"  src=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/onion-juice-7.jpg\" alt=\"onion smell bad- onion smell\" class=\"wp-image-2897\"\/><\/figure>\n<\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Doesn&#8217;t your hair smell terribly like onions?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Not at all! We have often read that the hair stinks after the onion hair mask. But it&#8217;s just often done wrong! To avoid the smell, one should make the onion hair mask together with the lemon juice. The yogurt also neutralizes the smell very well. Mixed the onion juice with the lemon juice and yogurt, the mask almost no longer smelled onions unpleasantly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides these, the smell of onion is unpleasant, and using these compounds may bother you with the smell of onions. But don&#8217;t worry if your hair smells very bad after using onion juice. You can get rid of the bad onion smell by doing several things. First, wash your hair thoroughly with shampoo after the onion cleanses and rinse it out several times; the scent will disappear by itself. By the time your hair is air-dried at the latest, nothing should remind you of your treatment with onion juice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, you can just add a few drops of fragrance oil to the onion juice to cover the smell. Essential oils made from lavender, rosemary, or mint are particularly suitable for this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How long should onion juice stay on the head?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After about 20 to 30 minutes, wash off the onion mask. Onion juice is rich in sulfur, and if it is not washed properly, onion sulfur remains in the skin and causes skin irritation, which is one of the disadvantages of onion juice for hair.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Possible side effects of using onion juice on the skin:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have sensitive skin, one of the side effects of onion juice on your hair may be irritation, redness, and itching of the scalp.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe you have a question, how many times a week should onion juice be used for hair? It is better not to use it more than twice a week.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-container-8 wp-block-gallery-7 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"500\" data-id=\"2898\"  src=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/onion-juice-9.jpg\" alt=\"Onions juice for fuller eyebrows\" class=\"wp-image-2898\"\/><\/figure>\n<\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Onions juice for fuller eyebrows<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyone not blessed with lush brow growth can also reach for the onion because exactly the sulfur compounds that work wonders on the head should also help with the eyebrows. You can either dab the juice of onion onto your eyebrows using a cotton swab or peel the onion, quarter it, cut off the edges and rub the piece of onion directly over your eyebrows. With both variants, the brows should be worked on for about five minutes, then let everything dry briefly and wash off again with a cleaning lotion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to get onion juice?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is best to blend the onion in a high-performance blender (with one tablespoon of water to help if necessary) to a pulp-like, fine mass. The onion juice can be obtained easily by pressing the pulp through a fine sieve (e.g., tea strainer). Alternatively, you can take a clean kitchen towel and squeeze out the juice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>This is how it works: onion juice for hair growth.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>But actually, it doesn&#8217;t matter how onion juice makes your hair fuller &#8211; as long as it works.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a better effect of onion juice, you can combine it with other ingredients and finally use the created hair mask.
