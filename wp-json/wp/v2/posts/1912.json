Understanding the culture of your destination country is one of the most important steps in knowing how to export. Carefully study the language and culture of your target market and do not overlook the importance of this issue. Because if your product is successful with a promotional approach in your own country, then it does not necessarily mean that it can be successful with the same approach in another country with a different culture. So, the importance of studying the culture and language will help you to better communicate with the customer and how to export.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from the cultural issue, research your product in your target market and know if there are products like yours there and compare the price and quality with yours and your competitors to determine the market value of your product. Ask yourself how much your customer needs what you are selling and at the price that brings you the profit? Always check the amount your product requires based on market requirements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"500\" src=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/marketing.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1909\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marketing<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, the subject of marketing is much broader than ever and its importance in any business is very high that in successful companies, many budgets and people are defined for this sector. It is enough to market and advertise a mid-range product very well to reach high sales or to lead a quality product to failure with mistaken marketing. Professional marketing pays attention to every detail. Careful studies are being conducted in this area and are constantly evolving. From product support to the smallest details in product packaging can be important. Tips such as pre-launch product introduction, application manual, customer relationship management, customer complaints, and other factors are critical to successful marketing. You can easily manage all these issues by having a website and online support. This reduces costs such as renting or buying several buildings in different countries to have an agency. Pay special attention to social media. Use popular social networks such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, etc. to promote, advertise and support your products. You should examine the general use of these social networks in each country and follow the activity accordingly. You can also have a specific language page in cases where your customer is large in one language.
