According to the UAE Customs rules, Dubai imposes a duty of 4% of the CIF value of goods (price, premiums, freight included). Tax exemptions do not apply to food, pharmaceuticals, or other necessities. On the other hand, tobacco and alcohol are taxed by 25-50%. There are a number of import requirements that will not apply to exporters, but it is still beneficial to be aware of what they are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>License to import<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A license issued by the local authorities allows importers to purchase only goods related to the business sector listed on the license. Animal products, including beef and poultry, imported from another country must have a medical quarantine certification, along with a certificate of killing according to Islamic religious law (halal). Pork and lard are prohibited from entering this market. Muslims in the country of origin issue these certificates. Certified Halal products and services meet Halal standard requirements and adhere to Shari&#8217;ah law after an independent third-party and objective review. The only products that Muslim consumers trust is those with Halal certification marks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imports from Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia are eligible for incentives following their membership in the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf (CCASG). As a result, these countries do not impose import duties on goods imported into Dubai.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"500\" src=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/required-documents.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1856\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>What documents are required for exporting to Dubai<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Dubai requires standard import documents for all imported goods.
