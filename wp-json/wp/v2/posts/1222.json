Ninety percent of adults over 50 years old suffer from high blood pressure, which leads to heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, accelerated aging, and hair loss. Those with high blood pressure are usually curious to know that Is there any <strong>natural way of lowering high blood pressure<\/strong>? &nbsp;The answer is yes. To be more specific, a good option would be fruits. But it brings up this question that what are the <strong>fruits good for lowering blood pressure<\/strong>?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Definition of hypertension<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hypertension is a word for the common phrase of high blood pressure. When the heart beats, blood flows through arteries. Normal blood pressure is less than 120\/80 &nbsp;constantly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Causes of high blood pressure<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Genetic<\/li><li>Adverse changes in hormone level<\/li><li>A high amount of sodium taken<\/li><li>Chronically High insulin level<\/li><li>Chronic stress<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Is sodium an enemy?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hypertension is a genetic-based disease, but it can be controlled by what you eat. The first thing doctors always insist on is lowering sodium intake. By checking the amount of sodium of the product you are buying (mentioned at the back of their box), you can take control of your sodium intake.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A healthy normal person should take 2300 mg of it a day. However, for those with diabetes or kidney issues, the recommended amount of sodium intake should be 1500 milligrams. Therefore, the question &#8220;Is sodium an enemy&#8221; won&#8217;t be a yes or no question. Our body needs sodium but not too much!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"423\" src=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/sodime.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1229\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Physicians always indicate that a slight change in lifestyle and diet patterns can significantly change the health situation. This is a fact when it comes to hypertension.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A high amount of potassium and fiber are two essential elements found in fruit that decrease blood pressure. The American Heart Association recommends the DASH diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension). DASH diet focuses on lowering fat intake and capping sodium. &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best fruits for lowering blood pressure<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Start with focusing your grocery list on these healthful fruits for lowering blood pressure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Avocado<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Avocado has potassium and magnesium. Studies on fruits that lower blood pressure found a link between magnesium and lowering blood pressure. This substance keeps your vessel relaxed and prevents constricting. Magnesium is also a help for the transportation of potassium. Despite people&#8217;s belief, Half of an avocado has more potassium than a whole banana.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/avocado-for-lowering-blood-pressure.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1228\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Apricot<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The potassium content of this fruit is high. Many studies have shown that having optimum potassium equals having good blood pressure. You ought to eat a lot of them.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Banana<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Banana is notably rich in potassium but is low in sodium. Based on the FDA(The Food and Drug Administration), diets rich in potassium and low in sodium reduce high blood pressure risk. Increased sodium levels put pressure on the blood vessels and disturb water balance. Consuming food loaded with potassium like bananas <strong>lessens the pressure on vessels<\/strong> and eliminates excess sodium in the kidney. Also, potassium helps to maintain fluid and electrolyte balance in the body and regulates blood pressure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/banana-lower-blood-pressure.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1227\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Oranges<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Oranges are famous for having vitamin C. Recent research indicates that vitamin C helps to lower blood pressure and blood sugar levels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Blueberries<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>They have a natural compound called flavonoids. This element effectively improves endothelial function. There is a membrane called the endothelium that lines the inside of the heart and the blood vessels. Endothelial cells release substances that control vascular relaxation, by this function, <strong>regulate blood pressure<\/strong>. Recent studies show that having 2000 grams of blueberries two times a day<strong> reduces high blood pressure risk<\/strong>. Be careful to eat organic blueberries. Blueberries are incredibly susceptible to pesticides and other chemicals used in agriculture. Besides, it is vital to eat blueberries, not blueberries juice.&nbsp;Juicing includes removing the pulp and skin of the blueberries, which are beneficial for our body.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>garlic<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Garlic has nitric acid. Chemicals in this compound relax blood vessels and smooth muscle inside the artery, making the vessel flexible so blood can flow.&nbsp;Garlic <strong>decreases blood pressure<\/strong> by interrupting Angiotensin II production. It has been known as a <em>tightening<strong>&#8211;<\/strong><\/em>blood cell compound.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"473\" src=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/garlic-lower-blood-pressure.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1224\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>onion<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Since people do not like the smell of raw onions, they are often avoided. However, it is good to know that onions contain essential vitamins like vitamin C, E, and potassium. Onions are perfect for lowering sugar levels and cloistral levels that lead to lower blood pressure.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>One of the most risk factors in stroke and heart diseases is high blood pressure.
