After having comprehensive knowledge about your own and target market, you have to take the next step in the trading business, which is representing your business, which is not an easy step to take. It requires talent, accuracy, and exceptional knowledge. Here are some tips for you to take this step with fewer difficulties.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"500\" src=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/contact-the-support-organizations.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1574\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Contacting local business support organizations<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Businesses of all sizes are offered business support services by the Business Support Organization (BSO). In order to streamline important office processes, such as onboarding new clients, managing them, and nurturing leads, it was decided that they needed to automate specific tasks. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In your home country, your sector association can point you in the right direction for information. You can also find out what the target market in Europe is if you work with some of them. Your company can also reach European prospects through a member association. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your country&#8217;s chambers of commerce, industry associations, or business support organizations (BSOs) might be able to provide tips or services for finding potential buyers of fruits in Europe. Organizations that help companies find potential buyers go even further by organizing trade missions and exhibiting at trade fairs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"500\" src=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/association-in-european-sectors.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1575\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Using the lists of members of sector associations in Europe<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The next step in the trading business, which is very important, is to use the member lists of sector associations in Europe. Identify fruit and vegetable traders on the member lists of sector associations in Europe. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A major association and retailer of fresh produce in Europe can be found through Freshfel Europe. In addition to being a membership organization, Freshfel Europe has some associated members, which are organizations, associations, and corporations with interests in the fresh fruit and vegetable sector in Europe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A full range of companies from producers to wholesalers, traders, logistics, and retailers make up Freshfel Europe, with members located throughout Europe. Have in mind that, when contacting sector associations, be specific when describing your trade request. That is the point in this step of the trading business. In general, they don&#8217;t have extensive information on their members or facilitate foreign suppliers. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite this, you should try to request their assistance if your goal is clear and your request includes the interests of their members. It is highly recommended that you research the companies listed on the member lists of industry associations before contacting them. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You are more likely to leave a positive impression if you know what kind of company you are contacting. Be specific about why you were attracted to their company.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;Among its members are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>CSIF (Chambre Syndicale des Importateurs Fran\u00e7ais de fruits et l\u00e9gumes frais&nbsp;) in France<\/li><li>Fresh produce center in Netherland<\/li><li>Deutscher fruchthandelsverband in Germany<\/li><li>Fresh produce consortium in United kingdom<\/li><li>Fresh trade Belgium in Belgium<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"500\" src=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/registeration-in-trade-directories.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1576\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Registering in trade directories<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As another step in the trading business, registering in trade directories is required. These databases are a great way for identifying prospective buyers, but you can also use them to present your products. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Listed information or contacts with other traders may be published in some trade directories for a fee. Some services offer free trials so that you can determine if they are worth the investment. Register as a supplier or find direct buyers following your registration. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure that you select the directories that you use carefully and that your professional image is preserved. Making random posts across a lot of sites can make you seem desperate or cheap. As well as the listings of sector associations, there are no databases devoted explicitly to the fresh fruit and vegetable industry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"500\" src=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/contribution-in-support-programs.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1577\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Contribution in European support programs<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Several organizations in Europe provide information and support overseas exporters. Many of them encourage imports from developing countries and assist in connecting you to European importers. Check with them to find out if they have programs or opportunities for buyers in your area.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To mention some are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>CBI<\/li><li>IPD<\/li><li>SIPPO<\/li><li>EEN<\/li><li>OTGS<\/li><li>Finnpartnership<\/li><\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>after doing a comprehensive research what are you going to do? you have to start representing yourself. but how and where? read this article for further information.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":7,"featured_media":1573,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[213,214,217,216,218],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v15.5 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"steps in the trading business are required to be recognized.
