Steps to take for the establishment of a new company in Hong Kong are listed below:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Name your company<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When forming a Hong Kong company, you should first determine what your company&#8217;s name will be. The name of your new business entity cannot be the same name as anyone else&#8217;s already used or has used in the past.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"500\" src=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/business-structure.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2026\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Create your business&#8217; legal structure<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Build the start-up structure according to the needs and requirements of your company. Structure affects everything about your business entity, from how you do business to how you file taxes. Here are some options to consider when choosing the right structure for your business:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Company limited by shares<\/li><li>Company limited by guarantee<\/li><li>Branch office<\/li><li>Limited company<\/li><li>Partnership and proprietorship<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Your company must be registered<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you wish to establish a business in Hong Kong, you must register. Limited companies are very popular among entrepreneurs in Hong Kong because of the many benefits they provide. In limited companies, personal assets are protected from business risks, making them a legally separate entity. A limited company&#8217;s ownership and capital can be transferred and raised quite easily compared with other types of businesses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"500\" src=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/business-account.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2027\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Open a business account<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to formulate your own ventures, gaining access to financial services is essential. Establishing a personal bank account is a fairly straightforward process. Anyhow as a business owner, you are required to show more documentation to the bank.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Licenses and permits are required<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As the next step in starting a business in Hong Kong, obtaining licenses and permits is required. Depending on the type of business you have, there might be several types of permits and licenses. Government and online license services can help you to find out about licenses that suit your business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Taxes<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Companies doing business outside of Hong Kong are not subject to Hong Kong&#8217;s profit tax. In Asia and across the globe, Hong Kong has some of the lowest taxes. Hong Kong applies an 8.25% profits tax to businesses earning HK$2 million or more and 16.5% to everything after that. Capital gains are not subject to this tax.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Insurance requirements and pensions<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It is a requirement in Hong Kong that employees are enrolled in the mandatory provident fund scheme (MPF) prior to starting a new business. This ensures that all your employees of the company are covered by a proper policy. As well, make sure all part-time and full-time employees working for your company are between the ages of 18 and 65.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You can realize the benefits of starting a business in Hong Kong with reading this article. all about taxes and documents and regulations are mentioned here. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":7,"featured_media":2023,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[389,391,392,390,393],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v15.5 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"business in hong kong and all you need to know about it is mentioned in our article.
