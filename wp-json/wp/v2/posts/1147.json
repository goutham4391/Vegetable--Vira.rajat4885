She knew that, but she was playful like that, so she wrote it and hid it for me to find. during this time, I tried many apple pies from different places, but none would compare to my grandma&#8217;s. At last, I found it in a secret compartment in her jewelry box. I have looked there before, but I didn&#8217;t notice it has hidden places. Anyhow, it was like the most iconic <a href=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/fruits\/apple\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Iranian apple<\/a> pie recipe out there, but there was a secret ingredient, nothing like I have ever seen before, the sauce.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ingredients<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We will cover the whole story of our pie in detail; let&#8217;s prepare the ingredients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Crust dough:<ul><li>1, 1\/4 Flour<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>1\/4 teaspoon Sugar<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>1\/4 teaspoon salt<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>4 teaspoons ice water<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>3 to 4 teaspoons diced and Iced butter<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li>Sauce:<ul><li>1\/4 cup water<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>4 spoons of unsalted butter<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>1\/5 teaspoon of flour<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li>Ingredient for brushing the top<ul><li>1 egg &nbsp;<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>1\/4 teaspoon of sugar for 3 or 4 apples<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>1 teaspoon of cinnamon<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>3 or 4 apples<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Get ready for a new taste adventure because we aren&#8217;t just cookers who only cook, we try out new designs, techniques, and recipes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apple pie recipe key ingredient, the sauce<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We start with the sauce that fills the inside of the pie. Place the saucepan over medium heat.<br>Melt 4 spoons of butter over medium heat in the saucepan and mix it with 1\/5 spoon of flour. For about a minute, keep whisking and then add 1\/4 cup of water and sugar and then reduce the heat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it is done, you&#8217;ll have a caramel-like thick sauce, take the saucepan off the stove, and leave it aside to cool down. (see the picture)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"786\" height=\"439\" src=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/apple-pie-sauce.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1156\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em> <\/em>You need 3 or 4 apples. Peel all of them, then cut them in half to remove their cores and then slice them. Put the sliced apples in a bowl and sprinkle one and a half teaspoons of cinnamon evenly on the apples. Try to coat the apples with cinnamon completely, and then use all of the sauce you made earlier to coat the apples.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Crust Dough<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Put the flour, sugar, and salt in the bowl, mix them with diced butter, add ice-cold water, and mix them up until it&#8217;s not sticky anymore; if it is, you can add more ice-cold water. Split the crust dough into two pieces.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Flour dust the surface generously, then roll out your pie crust. Roll it for about 6-inch diameters, then Put it on a clean plate.<br>The next step in this apple pie recipe is pouring the mixture of the apples and the sauce in the crust&#8217;s center. Be careful not to spill on the edges of the dough.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Set that aside then roll the second crust dough out on a flour-dusted surface. Roll it.<br>Now, we are going to make strips out of the crust. You can use a pizza cutter to make ten strips. (see the picture)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"793\" height=\"424\" src=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/apple-pie-crust-stripped-1.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1153\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Take one of the longest strips from the center of your striped crust and put it right on the pie center. It is simple, put them in the same direction, starting from the longest strip right at the center down to the shortest ones on the edges but leaving a little space between them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"801\" height=\"447\" src=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/apple-pie-crust-dough.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1155\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p> Peel back every other strip and place one large strip in the other direction, down the center of the crust dough, then peel back the alternative strips and add a new one, and so on.
