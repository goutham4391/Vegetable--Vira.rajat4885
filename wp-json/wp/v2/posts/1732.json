When an export of technology or software to another country happens due to an EAR, it&#8217;s called re-export.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a matter of importance because you will need a license for your item, technology, or software to re-export from its current country to the same country (let&#8217;s call it Country C) if it needs a license for exporting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simply put, re-export is the act of exporting goods imported from foreign countries and used in the country already. Analytically, they need to be recorded separately. To analyze whether re-exports are indeed re-exports, i.e., not export of goods with a domestic origin through processing, additional information may be required.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"500\" src=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/re-export-and-re-import-differences.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1735\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is the difference between re-export and re-import?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You need to understand what is re-export and re-import clearly because re-importing and re-exporting are common expressions in international trade. Exports of foreign goods are called re-exports if we categorize them as foreign goods and domestic goods. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Re-exporting goods means importing them (they become foreign goods) then exporting them back. For instance, machines may be imported into a country for testing, and they may be returned once they have gone through necessary testing. Sending back machinery, in this case, is known as re-exporting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imports can be divided into foreign goods and domestic goods. Re-importing domestic goods is defined as the importation of domestic goods. Whenever a country exports goods to another country and then imports back those same goods, this is considered re-importing. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, a piece of machinery has been sent for testing to a country and then delivered back to the country once tested. Re-import is the process of bringing back machines.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Re-importing and re-exporting occur frequently due to non-satisfaction with quality measures by the exporters, non-conformance to buyer&#8217;s requirements, or exports for a particular purpose like an exhibition or project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"500\" src=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/noticable-notes.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1736\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Notice these notes when realizing what re-export is!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Re-importing exported goods is possible without paying basic customs duty and IGST.<\/li><li>The EAR relates to open source technology or software.<\/li><li>The export product needs to be different from the imported goods in order to qualify for incentives.

In addition to the Guidance on the re-exports website, the BIS has a host of other resources to help you better understand re-exports. You can contact BIS if you need help applying for a re-export license or classifying your products.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following BIS publications may be of interest to you:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Re-Export Controls slideshow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The De Minimis and Direct Product Rules webinar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"500\" src=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/what-is-the-de-minimis-rule.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1738\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>The De Minimis Rule<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the EAR, de Minimis items are any foreign-made items that incorporate, commingle with, or derive from controlled items exceeding:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10% for Cuba, North Korea, Sudan, Syria, and Iran.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 25% for all other destinations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Controlled content must be less than 25% of your finished product&#8217;s value (or 10% or less inapplicable countries), or you will be eligible for the De Minimis Exception, which will not subject your product to the EAR.
