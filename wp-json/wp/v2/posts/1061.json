Diet can change the instruction of body cells, including the skin&#8217;s cells.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Treatment&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For many years, dermatologists have tried numerous treatments, including chemical peel or laser-based treatment. Still, none of these methods had satisfying results.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Studies found a link between skin aging and diet. People tend to make the mistake of investing in lotions and surgeries instead of preventing skin aging with fruit and vegetables.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Diet influences the amount of collagen and elastin fibers that exist in the third layer of the skin. Fruit as a non-cooked food can affect the process of generating collagen.<br>Unfortunately, some claim to be an expert on food and diet. Still, nothing is more important than your health condition, especially your skin, so it is very important to follow an expert lead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now it is time to get deeper into the topic &#8220;Fruits effect on the skin.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best anti-aging fruits<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Fruits with a high amount of vitamin C and antioxidants like pomegranate and tomato are the best anti-aging fruits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/tomato-good-for-skin.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1066\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Fruit reduces the risk of skin cancer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>damaged DNA is a factor in damaging skin cells that could cause skin cancer. Beta-carotene, vitamin C, vitamin E, and selenium can help skin cells fight off tumors (every cancer starts with tumor, as many of you know, When normal cells grow and divide too much or do not stop when they should, an abnormal mass of tissue is formed. These massed cells are called a tumor)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Studies on fruits&#8217; effect on skin found that a diet loaded with fruit and vegetables may help protect skin from cancer. Protecting cells from DNA damage is another significant effect of fruits such as grapeseed extract and raspberry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What fruit should I eat and why?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Fruits&#8217; effect on the skin can&#8217;t be ignored.
