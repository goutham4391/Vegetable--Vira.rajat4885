These network members work together to fight viruses and infections.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first factor in the immune system&#8217;s health is vitamin C which contributes to the synthesis of white blood cells. Vitamin C deficiency results in fewer white blood cells and a weak immune system. The good news is fruits that contain vitamins C are commonly available in all seasons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vitamin C supports the production of interferon. Interferons are particular proteins made by cells. Every cell in our body makes and releases two kinds of interferons called alpha and beta, and white blood cells release gamma.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/vitamins-for-immune-system.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1238\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In case of a cell infection with viruses or other germs, body cells send interferon-alpha and interferon-beta as a warning signal to white blood cells. The message triggers them to release interferon-gamma. This interferon fights off the infection.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>B6 contributes to producing a specific protein called interleukin-2, which directly involves white blood cells&#8217; actions. Vitamin B6 deficiency also decreases the synthesis of white blood cells, including T cells (kind of blood cells).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vitamin E, as an antioxidant, plays a significant role in protecting white blood cells.<br>Vitamin A is another element that also plays an essential role in the synthesis and functions of the two types of white blood cells, B and T, which both possess the ability to fight infections.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>White blood cells, specifically lymphocytes, require iron for proliferation and maturation.<br>The immune system is strengthened by zinc, as zinc activates enzymes that break down proteins in viruses and bacteria, preventing them from spreading.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What fruits improve immune system functions?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Carrot is known as a fruit with a high amount of vitamin A; two medium carrots provide all the vitamin A we need daily.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"532\" src=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/carrot-good-for-immune-system.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1236\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>One cup of orange provides more than the recommended amount of vitamin C for the body.
