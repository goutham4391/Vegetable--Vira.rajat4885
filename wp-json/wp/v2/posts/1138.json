However, this can also contain special fruit juices because some recommended fruit juices for gastritis are anti-inflammatory or have specific other properties that can help with stomach aches. We present three fruit juices for gastritis that you can drink when you have gastritis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Healing fruit juices for gastritis<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Gastritis<\/strong> is inflammation of the lining of the stomach. It can appear suddenly. But it can also develop slowly and get worse over time. Usually, it is certain drugs (e.g., painkillers) or unhealthy eating habits that lead to gastritis, e.g., Too much alcohol, too much coffee, too many fatty or spicy foods. Of course, stress is also one of the possible triggers of gastritis, which usually lowers the body&#8217;s defenses so that a Helicobacter infection can occur more quickly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bacterium Helicobacter pylori are responsible for most gastric mucosal inflammation (gastritis type B) and are also a significant cause of stomach cancer and duodenal ulcers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-normal-font-size\"><a href=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/fruits\/onion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><mark style=\"background-color:#fcb900\" class=\"has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color\">Iranian onion<\/mark><\/a><mark style=\"background-color:#fcb900\" class=\"has-inline-color\"> is good for health and the body<\/mark><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/gastritis.webp\" alt=\"Symptoms of gastritis\" class=\"wp-image-1132\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Symptoms of gastritis<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You can recognize gastritis by the following symptoms<\/strong>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Burning sensation in the stomach or esophagus<\/li><li>stomach pain<\/li><li>Eructation<\/li><li>Nausea and vomiting<\/li><li>Loss of appetite<\/li><li>Bloated stomach<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from being very uncomfortable, gastritis can have serious consequences, including long-term gastric ulcers and stomach cancer &#8211; if not taken care of.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Foods that are prohibited in gastritis<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The following <strong>fruit juices and smoothies can help you heal your gastritis faster<\/strong> and reduce the need to resort to medication. Besides, a light diet is, of course, always recommended. However, this is nothing more than a completely normal healthy diet. Only those foods that are simply not good for the stomach are forbidden &#8211; regardless of whether it is healthy or unhealthy:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Fried<\/li><li>Strongly spiced<\/li><li>Sweets<\/li><li>Dairy products<\/li><li>Fat meat, fat sausage<\/li><li>Fat finished products such as ready-made sauces, dips, mayonnaise, etc.<\/li><li>Carbonated drinks (soft drinks, sodas, etc.)<\/li><li>Coffee and alcohol<\/li><li>Acid juices from concentrate, e.g. Purchased orange juices<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>3 natural fruit juice recipes for gastritis<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So while store-bought juices made from concentrate or store-bought smoothies (which are often sweetened) are anything but good, there are various fruits, vegetables, herbs, and roots that &#8211; intelligently combined &#8211; help heal the stomach lining. We introduce three natural fruit juices for gastritis. The following recipes are for 1 serving a day each.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"536\" src=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/pineapple-ginger.webp\" alt=\"pineapple and ginger\" class=\"wp-image-1135\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>1. Pineapple-ginger juice<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ginger is a great healer on many levels. Ginger also has many advantages for the gastrointestinal tract. It is traditionally used for constipation, gas, stomach ulcers, nausea, and nausea.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ginger can protect against irritants that can damage the stomach, e.g. indomethacin (a pain reliever), and alcohol. Ginger can also protect against damage caused by the stomach bacterium Helicobacter pylori and thus prevent gastric ulcers from developing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pineapple supplies the famous enzyme bromelain. It has been shown in various studies to be anti-cancer, gastric, and colon cancer. In addition, the pineapple juice tastes delicious and harmonizes wonderfully with the ginger already described above.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cucumber slightly buffers the sweetness of the pineapple, provides additional soothing bases, and the aloe Vera gel provides anti-inflammatory and wound-healing benefits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ingredients:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>1 cup of fresh pineapple pieces<\/li><li>1 cucumber<\/li><li>1 piece of fresh ginger<\/li><li>1 tbsp. aloe Vera gel\/juice<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Preparation:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Extract the juice of the first three ingredients with a juicer and then stir in the aloe Vera gel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"908\" src=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/apple-avocado.webp\" alt=\"apple and avocado\" class=\"wp-image-1130\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. Apple and avocado smoothie<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color\">Iranian apple are rich in pectin (soluble fiber), which protects the stomach lining, absorbs excess acid and at the same time regulates digestion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Avocados provide easily digestible fats, relieve heartburn, and have a lasting satiation feeling. In model experiments, avocado extracts were able to inhibit the development of gastric ulcers and protect the gastric mucosa from damage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-normal-font-size\"><mark style=\"background-color:#fcb900\" class=\"has-inline-color\">Everything about <\/mark><a href=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/fruits\/apple\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><mark style=\"background-color:#fcb900\" class=\"has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color\">Iranian apple<\/mark><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ingredients:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>4 low-acid apples, green apples are more acidic than red ones &#8211; peeled and cut into pieces<\/li><li>2 avocados \u2013 only use the pulp<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Preparation:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mix the two ingredients and stir them until you have a creamy smoothie.

Papaya and banana smoothie<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Regular consumption of bananas can also protect the stomach lining from irritation and damage and therefore reduce the likelihood of developing gastritis or a stomach ulcer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As in apples, bananas contain pectin and phosphatidylcholine (lecithin), especially the green ones, i.e. unripe bananas. These two substances strengthen the mucous phospholipid layer that lines and protects the stomach lining.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The unripe banana also contains a lot of leucocyanidin, a flavonoid that protects the gastric mucous membrane from erosion by making it thicker and thus increasing the self-protection of the gastric mucous membrane.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like many of the other fruit and vegetables mentioned above, the banana can also protect the gastric mucosa from drug-related damages, e.g. by aspirin, indomethacin, cortisone, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The papaya is also significantly richer in healing substances when it is unripe compared to when it is fully ripe. This is very practical since it is often difficult to get really sun-ripened fruits anyway.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Papaya also has a gastric mucosal protective effect and therefore fits perfectly into a smoothie for gastritis or to prevent gastritis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even the papaya seeds have a ton of health benefits in store. They have a particular effect on the intestines, where they help drive out parasites. Since the papaya seeds are quite hot (spicy and bitter), you should dose them carefully if you have gastritis. Papaya seeds can be mixed in smoothies (6 &#8211; 8 per glass is sufficient). But you can also dry them, put them in the pepper mill and use them as a pepper substitute.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ingredients:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>1 cup of papaya chunks<\/li><li>A few papaya seeds if desired<\/li><li>1 banana (preferably unripe)<\/li><li>\u00bd cup of rice drink<\/li><li>1 tbsp. white almond butter<\/li><li>1 teaspoon yacon syrup (if sweetness is required)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Preparation:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mix all the ingredients in a blender and drink for breakfast.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-normal-font-size\"><mark style=\"background-color:#fcb900\" class=\"has-inline-color\">If you looking for fresh fruits: <\/mark><a href=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/fruits\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><mark style=\"background-color:#fcb900\" class=\"has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color\">Fruit export company<\/mark><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Important: Proper drinking of juices with gastritis<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember to drink the juices and smoothies very, very slowly, especially if you have gastritis.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Gastritis is inflammation of the stomach lining.
