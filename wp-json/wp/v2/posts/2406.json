Before doing so, the importer must follow some steps. Having a Certificate of Incorporation\/Registration in Nigeria is a must for the importer before shipping. A Tax Identification Number (TIN Number) is allotted upon the successful submission of a valid e-mail address along with proof of tax payments presented to the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS). As the Authorised Dealer Bank, a bank of your choice in Nigeria is the next must that needs to be taken into account. The Bank is responsible for the processing of Form M\/PAAR and acting as a middleman between the importer, the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), and other agencies. The next step is getting ready to clear the goods through Customs. Any regulated items must be accompanied by his Regulatory Certification, for example, the PC.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"500\" src=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/what-documents.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2408\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Requirements and documentation for importing to Nigeria<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Imports are now subject to destination inspection in Nigeria instead of pre-shipment inspections. As a result of this policy, all imports enter Nigeria for inspection. Consequently, clearance times are significantly increased. Despite spending several millions of dollars on scanners, GON (Government Of Nigeria) rarely uses those scanners, and they are often in disrepair.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is a list of documents an importer needs to submit in order to import to Nigeria:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Product certificate<\/li><li>Single goods declaration<\/li><li>A bill of lading<\/li><li>Commercial invoice exit note<\/li><li>Packing list<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It was also mandatory for the importer to submit a combined certificate value and origin (CCVO). A reminder that in April 2017, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) updated its trade transaction guidelines in accordance with international trading procedures and stakeholders&#8217; recommendations. According to the revision, processing time should not exceed 48 hours from the receipt of the application.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"500\" src=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/step-by-step-importing.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2409\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to import to Nigeria step by step<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Purchasing Products<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you have selected your products, you need to find out where you can purchase them.
