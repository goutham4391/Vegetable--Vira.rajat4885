Between baking and cooking apples, baking apples should hold their shape relatively well and have a less mushy texture than a cooking apple so the apple tart you painstakingly arranged doesn&#8217;t turn to an indistinguishable mush in the oven. In contrast, most recipes that call for &#8220;cooking apples&#8221; are usually looking for a variety that has a more tender texture and breaks down easily to make sauces and stews.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The differences in textures are variations of the apple variety&#8217;s genetic code, which determines the cell structure, acid content, and amount of space between the cell walls. Two apples might look identical to you, but depending on what two species each variety was bred from their applications might be completely different.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-normal-font-size\"><mark style=\"background-color:#fcb900\" class=\"has-inline-color\">Read about <\/mark><a href=\"https:\/\/virafruits.com\/fruits\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><mark style=\"background-color:#fcb900\" class=\"has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color\">Fresh fruit exporters<\/mark><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To further geek out about apples, one issue you might encounter when using apples with your cooking is the unappealing brown color that you&#8217;ll find quickly develops once the fruit has been cut. This phenomenon is a process known as &#8220;oxidation,&#8221; which is when a special enzyme inside the apple reacts to being exposed to oxygen. While most moms and lunch ladies have probably educated you on the fact that there is nothing wrong with eating some apple slices after they&#8217;ve been out for a few hours and gotten brown, there is actually a gradual loss in Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid) that occurs during this reaction. An easy way to slow down this process is by squeezing some lemon juice on the sliced apples, or sprinkling a little of our Lemon Juice Powder on them.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The most popular varieties of apples in planting and global agriculture trade are an essential factor for any businessman.
